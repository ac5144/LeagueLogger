## About
This is a website developed to support players of the popular MOBA League of Legends. The project began as a way to test web development concepts acquired from an online course. Players are able to log important notes that are categorized by the game's 100+ playable champions. This project utilizes Mongoose, ExpressJS, and Node.js.
